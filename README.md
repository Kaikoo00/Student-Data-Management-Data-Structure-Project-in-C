#Student Data Management
## This is a Student Data Management System project built using C programming with the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. 
### The system allows you to manage student records effectively, offering functionalities like adding, removing, searching, and displaying student data.

**Features:**
* Add Student: Insert new student records into the system.
* Remove Student: Delete existing student records.
* Search Student: Look for a student's data using their ID.
* Display Student List: View all students in the system in an ordered manner.
* Efficient Data Management: Utilizes a Binary Search Tree for optimized search and
retrieval operations.

**Prerequisites:**
* A C compiler like GCC.
* Basic understanding of C programming and data structures, especially Binary Search Trees.

**How It Works:**
Binary Search Tree (BST):
The core data structure of this system is a BST. 
Each node represents a student, containing fields like student ID, name, and age. 
Operations such as insertion, deletion, and search are performed on this tree structure.
